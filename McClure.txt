Troubleshooting the following issues: error checking to allow for the Toy Story to be added into the database without the length; html imbedded in php not allowing the return to the page with the video list after the video add--suspected to be an issue between server capability and work-around was implemented with a form taking the user to a page showing video add success; ran through testing protocol one last time; renamed log file with last name per directions
